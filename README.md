# Probabilistic-Models-for-FFP-Interpretation
This study quantifies uncertainties in interpreting free-fall penetrometer (FFP) data in clay and develops predictive models for static tip resistance using FFP acceleration and velocity via Bayesian inference and three probabilistic MLP methods: MaxLike, MaxLike + MCD, and Bayesian MLP-VI.
# Probabilistic Models for FFP Interpretation

## 🧭 Overview
This repository contains the complete set of machine-learning and probabilistic models developed for interpreting **Free-Fall Penetrometer (FFP)** data, with a focus on estimating quasi-static tip resistance (*qₛ*) and quantifying both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.  
The models were implemented as part of the associated journal paper, and this repository serves as the **supplementary reproducibility package** for that study.

The workflows combine **deterministic**, **maximum-likelihood**, **Bayesian**, and **hierarchical random-effects** modelling to produce reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates on the NGI **Log-Data-C** dataset.
